    <h2>Easy not-quite-risotto to terrify your friends</h2>
    <p>I made this recipe once for a friend and made the mistake of calling it <em>rice and peas</em>. I have since been informed it is nothing of the sort. Still, I like it!</p>
    <p>Again, this recipe is <em>easy to shop for</em>. You should be able to get pretty much all of the ingredients at a cornershop, let alone a supermarket, and it's not too heavy to carry home.</p>
    <p>Without further ado, let's get cooking!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice, I use Basmati</li>
        <li>1 can Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>1 can (yes, <em><strong>can</strong></em>) beans of your choice. I like gungo or blackeye peas. I also like not spending my freetime rehydrating beans, so I get a can and have done with it.</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>2 or so Vegetable Stock Cubes</li>
        <li>All Purpose Seasoning</li>
        <li>1 or 2 chillies, fresh or dried. I like Jamacian Jerk or Lemon Drop variety.</li>
        <li>Quite literally any cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prep</h3>
    <h4>Not too much for this one!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Dice your Onion.</li>
        <li>Dice your chilli.</li>
        <li>Boil a kettle and make up <strong>400 ml</strong> of stock using the aforementioned stock cubes.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Actual Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan on a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook until sweated (translucent).</li>
        <li>Add your all purpose seasoning and chilli and fry off until fragrant (like a minute or so).</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk. When the pot is up to a simmer, add the stock, rice and beans.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook on low until the rice is cooked. You might need to <em>drain the rice</em> at the end (quelle horror!)</li>
    </ol>
