    <h2>Sweet! Sour! Curry!</h2>
    <p>Another quick, easy-to-make and <em>easy-to-shop for</em> recipe. You can fit everything you need to buy for this recipe into one backpack or tote easy.</p>
    <p>Without further ado, let's get cooking!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Prawns</li>
        <li>Naans. Cornershop ones are usually better than supermarket ones. Or be fancy and make your own, but I won't tell you how to, because I don't know how to do that.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Ground Turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cumin Powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Curry Powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cumin Seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Fresh Ginger</li>
        <li>4 or 5 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Tamarind Paste</li>
        <li>2 & 1/2 tablespoons Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>100g or so Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Quite literally any cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prep</h3>
    <h4>While you <em>could</em> do some of these steps whilst cooking, I find it personally brain-breaking. So here's what to do first!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180Â°C (fan), and cook the naans.</li>
        <li>Boil a kettle and set aside <strong>150 ml</strong> of water.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Actual Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a wide base pan on a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Simultaneously, heat another pot over medium heat, and add the cumin seeds once hot. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the seeds are toasted, but not burnt. Then, add the rice and stir. Add the turmeric and <strong>250 ml <em>cold</em></strong> water, again with a pinch of salt, and bring to the boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 10-12 minutes/until the rice is cooked. Once cooked, remove from heat but keep covered.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking and once the onions have softened, add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant (1-2 minutes).</li>
        <li>In the curry pan add the ground cumin, curry powder, cayenne pepper and tomato paste and stir.</li>
        <li>Again, in the curry pan add the tamarind paste with your boiled water and approximately 2 teaspoons of sugar. Stir again and adjust salt/sugar to taste.</li>
        <li>FInally, add the prawns to the curry pot and cook until they are cooked through and you are satisfied with the thickness of the curry. Serve with rice and naans.</li>
    </ol>
