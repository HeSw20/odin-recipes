    <h2>High Protein, Easy-To-Make Easy-to-Shop Casserole</h2>
    <p>This recipe is quick, easy-to-make <em>and</em> (something I don't often find included in online recipes) <em>easy-to-shop for</em>. You can fit everything you need to buy for this recipe into one backpack or tote. Pedestrians and 90 lb weaklings rejoice!</p>
    <p>The protein I opted for is <em>Pheasant</em> and <em>Venison</em>, mainly because they come pre-packaged together in the supermarket. Feel free to use whatever meat or protein source you prefer, given it can withstand a relatively long cooking time. And please note, this recipe <strong>includes alcohol</strong>!</p>
    <h4>Want or need to sub-out alcohol? Try vinegars instead!</h4>
    <p>Without further ado, let's get cooking!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g Pheasant</li>
        <li>250g Venison</li>
        <li>2 Carrots</li>
        <li>1 Parsnip</li>
        <li>1/2 of a Butternut Squash</li>
        <li>7 or so Shallots</li>
        <li>2 or 3 Potatoes</li>
        <li>Sage</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Approx 1 teaspoon Juniper Berries</li>
        <li>4 cubes of Vegetable Stock</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons Redcurrant Jelly <em>or</em>Cranberry Sauce</li>
        <li>2 or so cups of Flour/Cornflour</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>2 glasses of Red Wine (Malbec/Rioja/Chianti will do)</li>
        <li>Quite literally any cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prep</h3>
    <h4>While you <em>could</em> do some of these steps whilst cooking, I find it personally brain-breaking. So here's what to do first!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If not done already, <strong>dice your meat</strong> into approximately <strong>1 inch cubes</strong>, on a seperate surface to your vegetables (or sanitize your prep surfaces after cutting meat). Toss the meat with Salt, Pepper and Flour to coat.</li>
        <li>Slice your carrots into rounds.</li>
        <li>Cube the parsnip and squash quite small, as these are dense starchy vegetables and tend to take longer to cook. Think <strong>Thumbnail sized</strong>.</li>
        <li>Quarter your shallots.</li>
        <li>Peel and slice your potatoes. You want enough slices to cover your casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Boil a kettle and make up <strong>300 ml</strong> of stock using the aforementioned stock cubes.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Actual Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan on a medium high heat. Once hot, add the shallots and cook until browned, then remove.</li>
        <li>Reoil the pan if needed, then add the meat (but not all the flour if it's swimming in it, come on) and brown.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is browned, add the 2 glasses of red wine, 300ml stock, carrots, parsnip, squash, the browned shallots, sage, thyme, juniper berries, and your redcurrant/cranberry sauce. Once you reach a boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a casserole dish, top with the potatoes and cook on 180Â°C (fan) for 90 minutes. You should be good to eat once the topping potatoes are crisped up. </li>
    </ol>
